# Terraform

## AWS configuration
To use Terraform, you have to gain a pair of AWS key/secret
See [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) (Using_CreateAccessKey) for ways to get it


After getting the AWS access key and access key secret, modify `~/.aws/credentials` as following:
```ini
[default]
aws_access_key_id = [your access key id]
aws_secret_access_key = [your access key secret]
```

To be able to remotely ssh into your ec2 instance, you also need to create an ec2 keypair
See [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) for ways to get it.

After getting your AWS EC2 private key, please save it locallyã€‚Then run the command to modify the permission of private key, otherwise it is possible to not be able to do ssh connection
```sh
chmod 400 [private key location]
```

## Ansible configuration
